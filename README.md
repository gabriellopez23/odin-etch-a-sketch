# odin-etch-a-sketch

## Description
A webpage inspired by Etch-a-Sketch with a customizable canvas grid. Other features include "rainbow coloring", where each cell drawn with a randomized color, and "darken coloring" where each cell interaction darkens the cell. The page idea is from The Odin Project's second project of the Javascript Module. 


## Learnings
The project's objective was to build an interactible Javascript project from scratch. A clean UI was required with the canvas only being modified through Javascript manipulation of the DOM.
